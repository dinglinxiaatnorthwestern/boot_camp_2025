# Syllabus: Python/MATLAB
**Instructor**: Dinglin Xia

## Session 2: Scientific Computing, Optimization, and Workflow Tools

### 2.1. Libraries & Tools for Optimization (40 min)

   - Python: `scipy.optimize`, `cvxpy`, `pyomo` (modeling + solvers).
-   MATLAB: Optimization Toolbox (linear, nonlinear, integer programming).

- Demonstration: solving a small LP in both Python & MATLAB.
- When to use Python vs MATLAB for optimization problems.

### 2.2. Efficient Scientific Computation: Writing Fast Code (40 min)
- Vectorization vs loops (NumPy/Matlab matrix ops).
- Common pitfalls (nested loops, inefficient data structures).
- Profiling tools: `timeit`, `line_profiler`, MATLAB Profiler.
- Hands-on exercise: optimize a slow piece of code.

### 2.3. Workflow Enhancement Tools (30 min)
 - Python desktop productivity: Jupyter Notebook tricks, VS Code extensions (Python, Jupyter, Markdown, GitHub Copilot).
- MATLAB tips: Live Scripts, exporting to LaTeX/PDF, integration with Excel/CSV.
- Short activity: build a reproducible workflow example (load â†’ analyze â†’ visualize â†’ save).

## Session 3: LLMs, GitHub, and Advance
### 3.1. How to Better Use LLMs for Coding (30 min)
- Prompting strategies (step-by-step, code refactor, debugging).
- Examples: ask LLMs to generate a function, explain code, translate Python â†” MATLAB.
- Pitfalls (hallucination, blind trust) and verification best practices.

### 3.2. GitHub for Personal & Research Workflow (40 min)
- Basics: repositories, commits, branches.
- Collaboration: pull requests, issues, versioning.
- Personal website with GitHub Pages:
  - Setting up Pages.
  - Hosting Markdown/HTML or Jekyll site.
  - Linking academic CV, projects, tutorials.

### 3.3. Application or Advanced Extensions (40 min)
- (Option A) Mini Project: End-to-End Workflow:
A project including using optimization, data analysis workflow
- (Option B) Advanced libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow for ML; Simulink for MATLAB)
